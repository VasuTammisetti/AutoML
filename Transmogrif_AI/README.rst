TransmogrifAI
TransmogrifAI (pronounced trƒÉns-m≈ègÀàr…ô-fƒ´) is an AutoML library written in Scala that runs on top of Apache Spark. It was developed with a focus on accelerating machine learning developer productivity through machine learning automation, and an API that enforces compile-time type-safety, modularity, and reuse. Through automation, it achieves accuracies close to hand-tuned models with almost 100x reduction in time.
